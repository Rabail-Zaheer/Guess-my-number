# Guess-my-number
A mini game I built to learn JavaScripts concept of DOM manipulation led by an instructor on Udemy. It was a fun project, a little code functionality for returning to the initial values was implemented by me that was given by the instructor as a coding challenge.
// A simple mini game in which only one player is involved, a random number is generated by the computer and the player has to guess it, the player will input the number he/she thinks is the number, if the number is higher than the guessed number, there will be a message displayed "The number is too high", if the number is lower than the guessed number, there will be a message displayed "The number is too low".
// If the user doesn't input any number and clicks the check button, then a message saying "No Number!" will be displayed.
There is a high score for everytime the user plays the game and it will be saved, when you click again button, your previous highscore will be saved. Highscore will be lost as you refresh the page.
When the user wins the game, the color of the screen will change.
